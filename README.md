<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Anurag Verma</h1>


I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Researcher** from in **India**. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Agra. I'm passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I'm a **Kaggle Notebook and Datasets Expert** and **Open Source Contributor**. I'm currently learning **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and **Pytorch**. I'm looking for **Remote Internship** opportunities in **Machine Learning** and **Researcher** roles.

I have a strong background in **math**, **statistics**, and **programming**. I am passionate about translating complex data into actionable insights. I have experience in building machine learning models and data analysis. I am a quick learner and enjoy working in a fast-paced work environment. I am looking for a position where I can apply my skills to real-world problems.
